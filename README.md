## UX

The goal of the project is to create a responsive and easily navigated site that attracts new members to the gym and provides them with relevant information.

### User Stories

* As a potential member I want easy access to information about what the gym offers.

* As a potential member I want to see images from the gym to get a feel if it is the right choice.

* As a potential member I want clear and simple instructions how to become a member.

* As a potential member I want easy access to contact information.


#### Wireframes and Mockups

A few notes on the changes I made from the mockups and wireframes. After consulting with my mentor at Code Institute I decided to change the navigation menu in the header.
I took inspiration from a particular gym's website (see credits) and I also made a few other minor changes to the finsihed project.

## Features

### Existing Features

* An easily accesible navigation bar at the top  that looks the same across all three pages, with which the user can navigate between the pages.
* A responsive gallery page where the user can scroll down and see images from the gym.
* A sign up form where the user can enter their personal info and sign up for a membership. (At this moment the submit button does not actually submit any info).


### Future Features

* Increased functionality in the image gallery page to make it possible to enlarge and view pictures in a separate window.
* Adding videos clips from the gym.
* Adding functionalty that sends an email to the user to confirm their membership.


## Technologies Used

* HTML

* CSS

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

Bootstrap was used to make the elements in the pages responsive with their container, row and col classes.
It was also used for buttons, navbars and modals throughout the project, which both saved time and provided functionality which would have otherwise required the use of custom JavaScript.

As part of the use of Bootstrap a few JavaScript libraries has been included (JQuery, Popper and Bootstraps own JavaScript library).

* [Fontawsome](https://fontawesome.com/)

Fontawsome was used to provide social media and contact icons.

* [Hover.css](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/hover.css)

The hover.css library was used to provide hover effects to the social media icons.

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

Google fonts was used to import the "Roboto" font which was used throughout the project.

* [Github](https://github.com/)

Github was used to store the repository and to deploy the project

* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)

Gitpod was the IDE used to create the project

* Git 

For version control through the gitpod terminal

* [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)

Adobe XD was used to create the wireframes and mockups for the project


## Testing

Chrome Developer Tool was used throughout the project to check the responsiveness of the pages. The project was also run across different webbrowsers such as Chrome,
Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge to make sure it looked the way it was intented.

The CSS code was run through the WC3 CSS Validator (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) without any issues.

The HTML code was run through the WC3 Markup Validator (https://validator.w3.org/) without any issues.

### User Stories

* As a potential member I want easy access to information about what the gym offers.

The genaral informationa about the gym is located on the index page and is responsive and easy to read on different screen sizes.

* As a potential member I want to see images from the gym to get a feel if it is the right choice.

The gallery page is easily accesible from the navbar across the pages, the images are the same size and looks well on different screen sizes.

* As a potential member I want clear and simple instructions how to become a member.

There is a link from the navbar aswell as a button located in the index page which leads to the signup page where clear instructions are given how to fill out the form and become a member.

* As a potential member I want easy access to contact information.

All of the contact information is located in the footer which looks the same across the pages. On large screen sizes the contact information is written out while on medium and small screen sizes there is a button to a modal that expands in front of the rest of the screen which makes it easier to read.
