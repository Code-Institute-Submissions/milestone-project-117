# Milestone Project 1

The project is intented to recruit members to a (fictional) gym. 

## UX


## Features

### Existing Features

* An easily accesible navigation bar at the top  that looks the same across all three pages, with which the user can navigate between the pages.
* A responsive gallery page where the user can scroll down and see images from the gym.
* A sign up form where the user can enter their personal info and sign up for a membership. (At this moment the submit button does not actually submit any info).


### Future Features

* Increased functionality in the image gallery page to make it possible to enlarge and view pictures in a separate window.
* Adding videos clips from the gym.
* Adding functionalty that sends an email to the user to confirm their membership.


## Technologies Used

* HTML

* CSS

* Bootstrap  (https://getbootstrap.com/)

Bootstrap was used to make the elements in the pages responsive with their container, row and col classes.
It was also used for buttons, navbars and modals throughout the project, which both saved time and provided functionality which would have otherwise required the use of JavaScript.

* Fontawsome (https://fontawesome.com/)

Fontawsome was used to provide social media and contact icons.

* Hover.css (https://cdnjs.com/libraries/hover.css)

The hover.css library was used to provide hover effects to the social media icons.

* Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/)

Google fonts was used to import the "Roboto" font which was used throughout the project.

* Github (https://github.com/)

Github was used to store the repository and to deploy the project

* Gitpod (https://www.gitpod.io/)

Gitpod was the IDE used to create the project

* Git 

For version control through the gitpod terminal

* Adobe XD  (https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)

Adobe XD was used to create the wireframes and mockups for the project


## Testing

Chrome Developer Tool was used throughout the project to check the responsiveness of the pages. The project was also run across different webbrowsers such as Chrome,
Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge to make sure it looked the way it was intented.

The CSS code was run through the WC3 CSS Validator (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) without any issues.

The HTML code was run through the WC3 Markup Validator (https://validator.w3.org/) without any issues.


## Deployment

The project was deployed on Github Pages by choosing the masterbranch in the settings page within the repository.
